   - Click "New +"
   - Select "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Choose the repository you forked

4. **Configure the service**:

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

2. **Visit your app** at the URL provided by Render
3. **Test the chatbot** by asking a question about Dovedale Primary School

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build fails**:
   - Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Ensure `render.yaml` is properly configured

2. **App crashes on startup**:
   - Check the logs in Render dashboard
   - Verify your `GROQ_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Make sure the database can be created

3. **Chatbot doesn't respond**:
   - Verify your Groq API key is valid
   - Check that the data collection script ran successfully
   - Look at the application logs
